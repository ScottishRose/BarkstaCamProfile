# ProjectTwo
Unit 2 Project

##Project MVP

When you sign up for barkbox you don't have the option to make a custom profile for your pet. I am going to build a form that you can fill out and customize your barkbox to your pets needs based on their breed, size, special needs etc. 

##Technologies 

- React
- Firebase
- Javascript
- Node Modules
- Babel
- html
- css
- webpack

##Next Steps 

Planning out the process and pseudo coding. Since I am making this to compliment an existing company/site style, I will also need to study the Bark and co site and it's code so I can keep in line with their brand. 

##Bonuses

I'll get back to you...
